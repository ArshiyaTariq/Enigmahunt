Level Descriptions: 

Krypton Level 0 → Level 1 
● Description: The first level introduces players to the game and the basic mechanics. Participants are tasked with decoding a Base64-encoded string to obtain the password for level 1. 
● Challenge: Decode the given Base64 string to access the password for level 1. 
● Skills: Basic understanding of encoding and decoding techniques. 

Krypton Level 1 → Level 2 
● Description: In level 2, players encounter a simple rotation cipher. The password for level 2 is encrypted using this cipher, with non-standard ciphertext formatting. 
● Challenge: Decrypt the ciphertext using a rotation cipher to reveal the password for level 2. 
● Skills: Understanding of simple substitution ciphers and ciphertext formatting. 
 
Krypton Level 2 → Level 3 
● Description: Level 3 introduces participants to the Caesar Cipher, a type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher. The password for level 3 is encrypted using this cipher, with the ciphertext provided in 5-letter groups. 
● Challenge: Decrypt the ciphertext using a Caesar Cipher to obtain the password for level 3. 
● Skills: Knowledge of Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption methods

Krypton Level 3 → Level 4 
● Description: Participants move beyond simple substitution ciphers and face a more challenging encryption mechanism. The password for level 4 is encrypted, and players must analyze intercepted messages to identify patterns and extract the password. 
● Challenge: Analyze intercepted messages to identify the password for level 4. 
● Skills: Cryptanalysis, pattern recognition, and understanding of common encryption weaknesses. 

Krypton Level 4 → Level 5 
● Description: Level 5 introduces players to polyalphabetic substitution ciphers, specifically the Vigenère Cipher. The password for level 5 is encrypted using this cipher, with the key length provided. 
● Challenge: Decrypt the ciphertext using the Vigenère Cipher with the given key length to reveal the password for level 5 
● Skills: Understanding of polyalphabetic substitution ciphers and key length analysis. 

Krypton Level 6 → Level 7 
● Description: In level 6, participants face a polyalphabetic cipher with an unknown key length. The text is written in American English, providing a clue for decryption. 
● Challenge: Decrypt the ciphertext with an unknown key length to obtain the password for level 6. 
● Skills: Frequency analysis, knowledge of American English language patterns, and cryptanalysis. 

Krypton Level 7 
● Description: The final level challenges players with a more sophisticated encryption technique involving stream ciphers. Players must utilize tools like cryptool to analyze and decrypt the ciphertext, which is encrypted using a weak random number generator. 
● Challenge: Decrypt the ciphertext encrypted with a stream cipher to access the password for level 7. 
● Skills: Understanding of stream ciphers, cryptanalysis, and familiarity with cryptographic analysis tools.
